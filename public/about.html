<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Target. I am a bull terrier. Joyful, playful, curious, adventurousâ€”it is hard to choose which word best describes me, but you might be familiar with
  the Target dog associated with the popular superstore, yeah that's me in the flesh.</p>

<p>I am playful and mischievous. I can sometimes get a bit stubborn but I love affection and physical activities.
   I am loyal and devoted to my humans. But I can become aggressive and over protective.</p>

<p>I have a distinctive egg-shaped head and muscular build. Smooth, shiny white coat with a black coat around my left eye.
I am loyal and affectionate, I love to cuddle with my humans all the time.
My triangular eyes gives me a mischievous and expressive look. I have goofy behavior and playful antics.
I can be strong-willed but I respond well to positive and reward methods.
I have protective instincts that makes me good watchdog. My loyalty to my family can translate into a protective nature.
I am very anxious at socializing with other dogs because I am not used to be around dogs. I am only comfortable socializing with female dogs and I play rough. 
I am comfortable being around humans and I love so playing with tiny humans me too!
